# View listing settings

Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

These settings define how your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products are listed on Amazon. Your listing settings consist of several categories that allow you to define the interactions and communication between Amazon sales channel and your respective [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.

When configuring your listing settings, you determine some basic functional parameters:

- Define your eligibility rules for your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products to automatically publish to Amazon as new listings
- Set up your Amazon listing prices based on your [!DNL Commerce] catalog or on competitor pricing
- Define your fulfillment method

Expand each of the sections and configure as needed.
