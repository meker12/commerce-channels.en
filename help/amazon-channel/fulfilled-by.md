# Fulfilled By

_[!UICONTROL Fulfilled By]_ settings are part of your store listing settings. Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

These settings define the party that fulfills (or ships) orders. If all of your orders are fulfilled using one method, choose between merchant (you) or Amazon. If you plan on fulfilling orders from your locations and using Amazon, it is a best practice to use the third option and configuring a [!DNL Commerce] product attribute.

- **[!UICONTROL Fulfilled by Merchant]** - Choose if you, the merchant, fulfill all orders. When an order is placed, inventory is deducted from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog.

- **[!UICONTROL Fulfilled by Amazon]** - Choose if Amazon fulfills all orders. With this option, product inventory is not deducted from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog when an order is placed. Inventory stock for Amazon fulfilled orders is stored and deducted from their warehouses. Before assigning this option, you must verify in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account that your products are eligible for _Fulfilled By Amazon_ (FBA) fulfillment. FBA inventory is directly managed through your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] Account. With this fulfillment method, Amazon sales channel does not share quantity updates between [!DNL Commerce] and Amazon. Therefore, not all marketing tools described in the Quantity Settings are available to you in Amazon sales channel.

- **[!UICONTROL Assign Fulfilled By Using Magento Product Attribute]** - If your products may be fulfilled by you and Amazon, you may want to create a [!DNL Commerce] product attribute with values for Fulfilled By Merchant and Fulfilled by Amazon. Setting this value per product indicates who fulfills the orders.

The fulfillment method is a regional attribute, and based on the **[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]** setting defined during [store integration](./store-integration.md). When a change is made, the change affects all Amazon listings that share that [!DNL Amazon Seller SKU] in your Amazon stores selling in the same region (as defined in _[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]_ during [store integration](./store-integration.md)). A change to a shared [!DNL Amazon Seller SKU] in the United States does not affect your Amazon stores set for a different region (as defined during the store integration).

>[!NOTE]
>
>When an order is fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) and the order is imported, you could see dummy data for some fields in the order details. See [Amazon Order Details](./amazon-order-details.md).
