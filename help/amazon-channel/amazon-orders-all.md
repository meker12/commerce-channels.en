# View Amazon orders

There are two ways to view your Amazon orders: _[!UICONTROL Recent Orders]_ and _[!UICONTROL All Orders]_.

Both options show you basic order information, as received from Amazon, including:

- Purchase Date
- Order Number
- Status
- Buyer's Name
- Grand Total
- Order Notes

_[!UICONTROL All Orders]_ view adds filtering options for order searches.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Except for the _[!UICONTROL Order Notes]_ column, the _[!UICONTROL Amazon orders]_ table is populated with order information as received from Amazon. The _Order Notes_ column is updated by [!DNL Commerce] as the order processes.

## Recent orders

You can view your most recent orders in the _[!UICONTROL Recent Orders]_ section of the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

## View all orders

You can view all of your Amazon orders on the _[!UICONTROL Amazon orders]_ page (also referred to as the _[!UICONTROL All Orders]_ view).

- [!UICONTROL Purchase Date (range)]
- [!UICONTROL Order Number]
- [!UICONTROL Buyer's Name]
- [!UICONTROL Total (range)]
- [!UICONTROL Status]

### Changing applied filters

- You can add to or change your filters in the _[!UICONTROL Filter by]_ section. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply filters]** to update the order list and the filter options that appear above the orders grid.

- You can remove filters, either one at a time by clicking the `x` for the filter or all at once by clicking **[!UICONTROL Clear all filters]**. Removing a filter updates the order list and the filter options that appear above the orders grid.

- If your order list is long, you can use the pagination controls below the grid to view more orders.

>[!TIP]
>
>A few tips about the orders view:
>
>- If you have multiple Amazon store integrations, a refresh of your page view when switching between store views could be required to update both the orders list and the pagination views for the current store.
>- When sorting by column, the sort only applies to the current list view. Filtering your list and then sorting the page you are viewing is a best practice.
>- Depending on the width of your view window, you may see overlapping text in the columns. To expand the columns for the text to wrap, widen your window view.
>- When filtering by _[!UICONTROL Total]_, filter by whole numbers. Entering a decimal amount may cause errors in the results.
