# Cancel an unshipped order

Amazon orders can only be canceled if they are in an `Unshipped` status. If the order is pending or partially shipped (unshipped), the order can only be canceled through your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. If the item has been shipped, returns and exchanges must also be handled in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] Account.

>- If you have [order import](./order-settings.md) enabled, orders are managed in the [[!DNL Commerce] orders workflow](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/orders.html){target="_blank"}.
>- If [order import](./order-settings.md) is disabled, you must manage your orders in [!DNL Amazon Seller Central].
