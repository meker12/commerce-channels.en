# Logs and store reports

The [!DNL Amazon sales channel] extension includes some valuable logs and store reports that allow you to view the changes that are affecting your Amazon listings and orders. You can use these reports to see what is happening in your store and to understand various listing statuses.

No actions are available for the logs or store reports, as they are review-only features.

The following logs can be accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

- The [Listing Changes Log](./listing-changes-log.md) shows the changes that have occurred in your Amazon Seller Account as a reflection of your [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] settings.

- The [Communication Errors Log](./communication-errors-log.md) shows any reported communication errors with Amazon.

The following store-specific reports can be accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

- The [Competitive Price Analysis](./competitive-price-analysis.md) report shows that your Amazon _landed price_ (listing price plus shipping price) in relation to the [Buy Box](./buy-box-competitor-pricing.md) price and [lowest competitor](./lowest-competitor-pricing.md) price.

- The [Listing Improvements](./listing-improvements.md) report shows all suggested listing improvements provided by Amazon for the selected store.
