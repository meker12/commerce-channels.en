# Create [!DNL Commerce] attributes for Amazon

Before onboarding your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] accounts, it is a best practice to add [!DNL Commerce] [product attributes](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/attributes-product.html){:target="_blank"} to map your product listings. After you complete onboarding, you can manage your product attributes through the [Attributes](./managing-attributes.md) tab of the [[!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] home](./amazon-sales-channel-home.md) page.

These instructions detail how to create [!DNL Commerce] attributes for Amazon ASIN and Amazon Condition. Creating additional attributes including Amazon EAN, Amazon ISBN, and Amazon UPC is recommended. You may want to also create an Amazon Price attribute if you want to use your Amazon listing price as a price source for pricing rules. These attributes are used when configuring your listing and pricing settings during onboarding. Also use these attributes when creating Amazon listings and when updating and syncing your [!DNL Commerce] catalog with your Amazon listings.

Catalog Search settings enable you to set matching search parameters that help to map eligible [!DNL Commerce] products with Amazon listings. When mapped, Amazon activates actions related to pricing, quantity, overrides, and order and product synchronization.

Defining these values increases the potential for exact matches, minimizing the need for manually matching product listings later. Adding the attributes as part of your onboarding [Pre-Setup Tasks](./amazon-pre-setup-tasks.md), [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] has a higher potential for automatically matching your products during onboarding and syncs product data between Amazon and [!DNL Commerce] after onboarding.

If you only create the Amazon ASIN attribute (without adding ASIN values per product), your [!DNL Commerce] products might not automatically match to your Amazon listings. You can manually match your products through _Store Review_. However, manual matching does not create the data elements that are required to share and sync your product data.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you update an ASIN, UPC, or other data element for a manually matched product, you must update the data in both places: your [!DNL Commerce] catalog and the listing in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.
