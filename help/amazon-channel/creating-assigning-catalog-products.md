# Create and assign products

When viewing _[!UICONTROL New Third Party]_ tab, you can match your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products to an existing Amazon listing. There are two options for this matching. You can assign a listing to an existing catalog product, or you can use the information from the listing to create catalog products. These options are helpful when your Amazon listings do not automatically match to your [!DNL Commerce] catalog.

Matching (or assigning) your products to your Amazon listings is necessary to use the full feature set of Amazon sales channel.

When you create a catalog product from an Amazon listing:

- The **ASIN** becomes the [!DNL Commerce] SKU
- The **Product Listing Name** becomes the Catalog Listing Name
- The **Price** and **Quantity** are imported from the Amazon Listing

The rest of the necessary settings are determined by the [!DNL Commerce] product settings you select during creation.

When created and matched, the listings remove from the _[!UICONTROL New Third Party]_ tab and appear on the _[!UICONTROL Active]_ tab.

## Assign a single catalog product to an Amazon listing
