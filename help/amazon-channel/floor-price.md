# Intelligent repricing rule: floor price

Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [[!UICONTROL Select Rule Type]](./intelligent-repricing-rules.md)
- [[!UICONTROL Competitor Conditional Variances]](./competitor-conditional-variances.md)
- [[!UICONTROL Price Adjustment]](./price-adjustment.md)
- [!UICONTROL Floor Price]
- [[!UICONTROL Optional Ceiling Price]](./optional-ceiling-price.md)

The [floor price](./floor-price.md) settings automatically protect your lowest product price against the intelligent pricing rules. Use these settings to set a floor (lowest price) for your intelligent pricing rules, ensuring that your products are not listed below a desired price.

Floor price attributes are based on the website scope if your [!DNL Commerce] store is using website pricing scope. See [Price Scope](./price-scope.md).

Floor price is only used when **[!UICONTROL Rule Type]** is set to `Intelligent repricing rule`.

## Configure floor price

Define your lowest price setting in the _[!UICONTROL Floor Price]_ section.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Floor Price Source]**, choose a price source attribute.

   Choose the [!DNL Commerce] [product attribute](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/product-attributes.html){target="_blank"} that indicates your relative floor limit. For example, if you do not want your Amazon listing price to go below the cost of your item, you would choose the *Cost* attribute.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Floor Price Action]**, choose an option.

   - `Decrease By` - Choose when you want the defined _[!UICONTROL Floor Price Source]_ value to be adjusted down, creating a lower floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

   - `Increase By` - Choose when you want the defined _[!UICONTROL Floor Price Source]_ value to be adjusted up, creating a higher floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

   - `Match` - Choose when you do not want the listing price to fluctuate below the defined _[!UICONTROL Floor Price Source]_ value. When set to `Match`, the _[!UICONTROL Apply]_ and _[!UICONTROL Floor Adjustment Amount]_ fields are disabled.

1. Leave the **[!UICONTROL Apply]** default as `Apply as percentage`.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Floor Adjustment Price]**, enter the numerical value for the percent to adjust your _[!UICONTROL Floor Price Source]_ value.

In this example, the floor price is set to be 3% above the cost of the item.
