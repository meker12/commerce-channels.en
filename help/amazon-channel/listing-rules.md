# Listing rules

You can access the listing rules for store in the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

Listing rules define the rules to determine which products Amazon sales channel publishes to Amazon. These rules provide many options to create simple to complex rules to include or exclude products as listings. Each rule consists of conditions that set the requirements for product listing eligibility.

Your listing rules are continually synchronized with your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. When you add new [!DNL Commerce] products that meet eligibility requirements set by your listing rules, the products are automatically processed for listing on Amazon.

- If you want all of your products to be published to an Amazon listing, do not define any conditions for your listing rules.

- If you want to limit which of your catalog products that are published to Amazon, you define your listing rule conditions. Defining the conditions for your Amazon listing rules follow the same logic and process as defining the conditions for [Cart Price Rules](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/price-rules-cart.html){target="_blank"}.

- If your listing rules exclude a product, the eligibility status for that product changes to `Ineligible`. Ineligible products are not published to Amazon.

- If an ineligible product is already listed on Amazon and you match the Amazon listing to your [!DNL Commerce] catalog product, the quantity for the Amazon listing changes to `0` to prevent sales of the product. Amazon listings can be [manually removed](./end-listings-manually.md).

Changes to quantity and eligibility status impact all listings that share the Amazon Seller SKU in marketplaces that exist for stores selling in the same region (as defined in _[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]_ during [store integration](./store-integration.md)). However, a change to a shared [!DNL Amazon Seller SKU] in one region does not affect the product's Amazon listings in a different country.

## Configure Listing Rules settings

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Listing Rules]** on the store dashboard.

1. Define your desired conditions for the eligibility of products to be listed on Amazon.

See [Example: Define a Condition](./ob-define-condition-example.md).

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|[!UICONTROL Websites]|The available options depend on the [websites](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/websites-stores-views.html){target="_blank"} you have set up in your [!DNL Commerce] configuration. Select the website for the eligible products listed on Amazon. Only one website can be selected, as each website requires a unique Amazon store created in Amazon sales channel. |
|[!UICONTROL Conditions]|Used to define the [!DNL Commerce] attributes for product eligibility within your Amazon region. See [Example: Define a Condition](./ob-define-condition-example.md). |

## Conditions workspace

Any areas in the conditions that are bold can be clicked to see the various options.

- Do not add conditions if all products within the selected websites are eligible.
- There is a complex set of back-end processes to communicate with Amazon's systems directly. Based on the number of items you are attempting to list, and how busy Amazon's systems might be (such as Black Friday), it could take time for your items to be listed on Amazon.

For more information about conditions, see [Describe the Conditions](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/price-rules-cart.html){target="_blank"}.

## Listing rule preview

When you are modifying your condition definitions for your listing rules, you can click **[!UICONTROL Preview Changes]** to apply your rules changes and view how your listings are impacted. Verify your listings in this listing preview feature before saving your listing rule changes.

Your Amazon listings are compared against your rules and defined conditions. You can then review:

- Which products move to an ineligible status based on your current [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account
- Which products move from an ineligible state back to eligible status
- Which products are New Amazon Listings and added to your Amazon listing from your eligible [!DNL Commerce] products

Listing Preview allows you to preview your potential Amazon listings and make any necessary adjustments to your listing rules.

Your potential Amazon listings populate on the _[!UICONTROL Listing Preview]_ page in one of three tabs:

- **[!UICONTROL Ineligible Listings]** - Products listed are not eligible for Amazon listing based on your current listing rules and conditions.

   Ineligible products are not published to Amazon. If an ineligible product is already listed on Amazon and you match the Amazon listing to your [!DNL Commerce] catalog product, the quantity for the Amazon listing changes to `0` to prevent sales of the product. To manually remove a listing, see [Ending an Amazon Listing](./end-listings-manually.md). Products that are not eligible by Amazon requirements are not listed here. Those products are listed on the [Inactive Listings tab](./inactive-listings.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Eligible Listings]** - Products listed are eligible for Amazon listing based on your current listing rules and conditions and are also eligible by Amazon requirements. This list includes your existing Amazon listings that import (if you have **Import Third-Party Listings** set to `Import Listing` in [Listing Settings](./third-party-listing-settings.md)).

- **[!UICONTROL New Listings]** - Products listed include your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products that are newly eligible for Amazon listing based on your current listing rules and conditions, and create and publish new Amazon listings.
