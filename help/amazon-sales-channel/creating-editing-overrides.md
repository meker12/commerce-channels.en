# Create and edit overrides

You can create and override for a listing or edit or remove an override that has been applied to a listing. Overrides set a defined value for a specific listing.

## Create an override for a single listing

The _[!UICONTROL Create Override]_ action is available when viewing listings on the _[!UICONTROL Inactive]_, _[!UICONTROL Active]_, and _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tabs.

1. View a listing on a _[!UICONTROL Products Listings]_ page (_[!UICONTROL Inactive]_, _[!UICONTROL Active]_, and _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab).

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column, click **[!UICONTROL Select]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Override]** to open the Product Listing Overrides page.

1. To ensure you are viewing the correct listing, verify the _[!UICONTROL Listing Details]_.

1. Determine the type of override you are creating.

   You can define a single override type or any combination of types for the listing (Price, Handling Time, Condition, Seller Notes).

   - **Price** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Listing Price]** and enter your defined price value for **[!UICONTROL Price Override]**.
   - **Handling Time** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Handling Time]** and enter the defined time value (in days) for **[!UICONTROL Handling Time Override]**.
   - **Condition** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Condition]** and choose the correct option for the **[!UICONTROL Condition Override]**.
   - **Seller Notes** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Seller Notes]** and enter your notes text for **[!UICONTROL Seller Notes Override]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Listing Override]**.

    The _[!UICONTROL Product Listing Overrides]_ page closes. The status of the listing changes to `Relist in Progress`. The change will be published to Amazon with your next data sync (as configured in your cron settings). The listing is also added to the _[!UICONTROL Overrides]_ tab.

The following example shows an override that defines a new price of `$55`, a new handling time of `1 day`, a new condition of `Used; Like New`, and new Seller Note text.

1. To edit your _[!UICONTROL Override]_ settings, define the sections for the type you want to change (Price, Handling Time, Condition, Seller Notes).

    To keep an override type the same, select `No Change To <override type>` (the default). This setting leaves the previously defined override value unchanged.

   - **Price** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Listing Price]** and enter your defined price value for **[!UICONTROL Price Override]**.
   - **Handling Time** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Handling Time]** and enter the defined time value (in days) for **[!UICONTROL Handling Time Override]**.
   - **Condition** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Condition]** and choose the correct option for **[!UICONTROL Condition Override]**.
   - **Seller Notes** - Click **[!UICONTROL Change Seller Notes]** and enter your notes text for **[!UICONTROL Seller Notes Override]**.

1. To remove an override type, click **Remove** for each of the types you want to remove. If not removed, the previously defined value remains in the override.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Listing Override]**.

    The _[!UICONTROL Product Listing Overrides]_ page closes. The status of the listing changes to `Relist in Progress`. The change will be published to Amazon with your next data sync (as configured in your cron settings). If not already listed, the listings are also added to the _[!UICONTROL Overrides]_ tab.

Piggybacking on the _Create an Override_ example. The following example shows an edit to the previously created override that defines a new price of `$50`, removes the Handling Time override, and keeps the previous Condition and Seller Notes overrides.
