If needed, you can update these credentials from the *Channel Settings* page.

* **[Map Unique identifiers](map-catalog-attributes.md)**–Before you connect listings from [!DNL Commerce] to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace], map at least one unique identifier from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog to the corresponding identifier from Walmart.
